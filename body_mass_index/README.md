## Screens

### Home

The Home screen is the initial screen that users see when they open the app. users can enter their weight, height, age, and gender.

### Result

The Result screen displays the calculated BMI based on the user's input from the Home screen. It also provides a feedback message indicating the user's BMI category (underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese).
